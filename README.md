## Welcome to the mapOnHolochain repo!
* mapOnHolochain is an overview tool for collaboration about many kinds of ideas for the map of where the  Holochain project may go

## What is it?
* mapOnHolochain tries to strike an innovative balance between formal and informal communications.
* Formal communications include tools like issue trackers, kanban tools, getFlow, etc.
  * currently *ideas for a plan* which is the project that mapOnHolochain uses only integrates with github
* the informal part is a great big diagram of all the ideas that people have come up with so far.
  * mapOnHolochain is a collaboration tool. Anyone can add ideas anywhere they like on the current map, and the holochain project will work to try and synthesise those ideas into something that makes sense. There is no formal procedure for this, just as there is no formal procedure for any discussion between people. However any protocols can be agreed between people as the project matures.

## Helping out - adding and discussing ideas
  * the web interface for mapOnHolochain is here: map.holohackers.org

## Helping out - submitting designs for changes to the background image
* If you would like to help the project leaders of Holochain to synthesize the content everyone is generating, you can!
  * You can place a googleDrawing or an svg into this directory, as a helping hand to the HolochainTEAM:
    * https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OPFnInEQ461IlNK21kQdj2Lt_c7OcPa1
  * Here are some templates to help you get started
    * https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1obvGgMuKQQ6qNYPBty63ZlYExCCTSXkLo3ilCZTIpnI
  * Suggestions you make make the most sense if they are placed somewhere on the existing background image
    * Once you have submitted something, please create an issue in the place you think it is most relevant on map.holohackers.org
      * put something like “backgroundImageSuggestion” in the title of your dot
  * thank you so much for contributing!
