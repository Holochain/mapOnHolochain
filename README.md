## Welcome to the mapOnHolochain repo!
* mapOnHolochain is an overview tool for collaboration about many kinds of ideas for the map of where the Holochain project might progess, like discussions of what might be good milestones, or paradigms or any idea at all that is relevant
* most people will want to ***just use*** mapOnHolochain:
  * Firstly, ***"watch"*** this repo (click on the image below for instructions, you may need to create a github user) 
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/239550/33098082-ff8f8a72-cec0-11e7-989e-7ca4a6b76fb7.jpg" height="200px">  
  
  * Then navigate to http://map.holohackers.org

> there is a kanban view of the same issues as are backing mapOnHolochain held here: https://waffle.io/Holochain/mapOnHolochain, which may be of interest to developers

## What is it?
* mapOnHolochain tries to strike an innovative balance between formal and informal communications.
* **the formal part** is this github repository. Formal communications include tools like issue trackers, kanban tools, getFlow, etc.
  * currently *ideas for a plan* which is the project that mapOnHolochain uses only integrates with github
* **the informal part** is a great big diagram of all the ideas that people have come up with so far.
  * mapOnHolochain is a collaboration tool. Anyone can add ideas anywhere they like on the current map, and then a core team works to synthesize those ideas into a holistic view of the space. There is no set, formal procedure for the synthesis, just as there is no formal procedure in general terms, for "discussion between people". However moving forward, protocols may well be agreed as the project matures.
