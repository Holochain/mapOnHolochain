## Welcome to the mapOnHolochain repo!
* mapOnHolochain is an overview tool for collaboration about many kinds of ideas for the map of where the Holochain project might progess, like discussions of what might be good milestones, or paradigms or any idea at all that is relevant
* most people will want to ***just use*** mapOnHolochain:
  * Firstly, watch this repo (you may need to create a github user)
    * ![watchgithubrepo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/239550/33098082-ff8f8a72-cec0-11e7-989e-7ca4a6b76fb7.jpg | height=200)
  * Then navigate to http://map.holohackers.org
  
## What is it?
* mapOnHolochain tries to strike an innovative balance between formal and informal communications.
* Formal communications include tools like issue trackers, kanban tools, getFlow, etc.
  * currently *ideas for a plan* which is the project that mapOnHolochain uses only integrates with github
* the informal part is a great big diagram of all the ideas that people have come up with so far.
  * mapOnHolochain is a collaboration tool. Anyone can add ideas anywhere they like on the current map, and the holochain project will work to try and synthesise those ideas into something that makes sense. There is no formal procedure for this, just as there is no formal procedure for any discussion between people. However any protocols can be agreed between people as the project matures.
